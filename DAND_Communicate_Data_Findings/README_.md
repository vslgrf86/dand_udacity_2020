# udacity-communicate-data
This project was part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. For the assignment, I systematically explored a dataset and produced a short presentation with selected visualizations.

# Motivation
 As part of the program, I was tasked with selecting a dataset, systematically exploring chosen variables, and producing a short presentation illustrating interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered. I chose a dataset from Prosper Loan, a California-based FinTech which facilitates peer-to-peer loans. Prospective borrowers request personal loans through Prosper, with individual or institutional investors choosing who to fund. The loans, worth anywhere from 2,000 to 40,000 USD, are distributed through Prosper. Prosper also collects and allocates payments and interests from borrowers to lenders. Investors make lending decisions based on a borrower's credit score, rating, and history, as well as the category of the loan ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosper_Marketplace)).

# Project Rubric
The goal of this project was to:

+ Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
+ Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing you to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
+ Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.

# Data Sources
The dataset itself was provided through Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program, but similar historical data can also be obtained directly through Prosper via an API, as long as the requester has a valid Prosper account ([source](https://prosper.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210013083-Where-can-I-download-Prosper-loan-data-)). Documentation for the dataset is available through [Udacity](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0) or [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/Downloads/Services/Documentation/ProsperDataExport_Details.html).
